<h1>The Best Movies According to Vidhya</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies off all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Vaaranam Aayiram</h3>
<p>Beautifully crafted by GVM and very well said about a beautiful after life after a heart wreck.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>One of my favorite time travel movies. Absolutely stunning movie that pictured the science terms that we heard into things that we can see!
</p>
<h3>Soorarai Potru</h3>
<p>Gives us a glimpse into a real life story of how one can achieve anything if one is determined and works continuously for it.</p>
